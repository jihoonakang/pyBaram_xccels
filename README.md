pyBaram
========

Overview
---------
pyBaram is an open-source Python-based software to solve compresible flow using finite volume method on unstructured grids. Baram means the 'Wind' in Korean. It is designed to solve compressible inviscid flow, laminar flow and turbulent flow using RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) models. All codes are written in Python and hybrid parallel simulations are employed using the high Performane Python packages, Numba [[1]](#1) and mpi4py [[2]](#2).
