pyBaram
========

Overview
---------
pyBaram is an open-source Python-based software to solve compresible flow using finite volume method on unstructured grids. Baram means the 'Wind' in Korean. It is designed to solve compressible inviscid flow, laminar flow and turbulent flow using RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) models. All codes are written in Python and hybrid parallel simulations are employed using the high Performane Python packages.

Examples
---------
Examples of using pyBaram are available in the examples directory. Currently available examples are:

- 3D Inviscid spherical explosion problem

- 2D transonic turbulent flow over RAE2822 airfoil
